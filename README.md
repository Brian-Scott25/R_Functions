## Project Purpose

This repository includes functions I have made in the R coding language. The main goal of these functions is to increase the speed of statistical analysis. The code is presented in the form of R markdown files, and the link to each specific function in RPubs is posted for each function.

## Log_Lag Function
#### RPubs Log_Lag Link: https://rpubs.com/BrianScott/948426
#### Purpose
This function quickly logs and lags a dataset, knowing to only log columns with all positive values, in order to avoid NA's. 
The primary use of this function is for the variable selection in regression models. This allows someone to quickly navigate through logged, raw and lagged model versions.  



## Corr_Reduce Funtion
#### RPubs Corr_Reduce Link: https://rpubs.com/BrianScott/948474
#### Purpose
This function helps to reduce the amount of potential variables for a regression model. The model produces a Full Datset Correlogram, a bar chart of significant variables, and a reduced correlogram of only the significant variables
