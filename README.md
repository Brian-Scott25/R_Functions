## Project Purpose

This repository includes functions I have made in the R coding language. The main goal of these functions is to increase the speed of statistical analysis. The code is presented in the form of R markdown files, and a link to my RPubs website will be provided. 

## Log_Lag Function
### RPubs Link: https://rpubs.com/BrianScott/948426
This function quickly logs and lags a dataset, knowing to only log columns with all positive values, in order to avoid NA's. 
The primary use of this function is for the variable selection in regression models. This allows someone to quickly navigate through logged, raw and lagged model versions.
